## Compatibility
Launch S3 is only compatible with disk versions of the game and will not work with the EA App, Origin, or Steam. It has only been tested with version 1.67 but should also work with older versions.

The launcher can start the game on newer Intel CPUs where the game is normally unable to run.

## Features

### Expansion and Stuff selection
Select what Expansion and Stuff Packs to use. The feature requires administrator privileges to set up, and may then be used by a regular user.

### Mod selection
Select what mods to use and add new mods. The launcher can also enable modding by downloading and extracting FrameworkSetup.
